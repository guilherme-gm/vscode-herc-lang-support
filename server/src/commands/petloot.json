The","curing actions will occur once every <delay> seconds. For a full list of","status conditions that can be cured, see the list of 'Status Changes' status","condition constants in 'doc/constants.md'","This command will turn on pet looting, with a maximum number of items to","loot specified. Pet will store items and return them when the maximum is","reached or when pet performance is activated.","This will make the pet use a specified support skill on the owner whenever","the HP and SP are below the given percent values, with a specified delay","time between activations. The skill numbers are as per","'db/(pre-)re/skill_db.txt'.","It's not quite certain who's stats will be used for the skills cast, the","character's or the pets. Probably, Skotlex can answer that question.","This command will make the pet cast an attack skill on the enemy the pet's","owner is currently fighting. Skill IDs and levels are as per petskillsupport().","If <number of attacks> is specified different than 0, it will make the pet cast","the skill with a fixed amount of damage inflicted and the specified number of","attacks. A value of zero uses the skill's defaults.","All commands with delays and durations will only make the behavior active","for the specified duration of seconds, with a delay of the specified","number of seconds between activations. Rates are a chance of the effect","occurring and are given in percent. 'bonusrate' is added to the normal","rate if the pet intimacy is at the maximum possible.","The behavior modified with the above mentioned commands will only be","exhibited if the pet is loyal and appropriate configuration options are","set in 'conf/map/battle.conf'.","Pet scripts in the database normally run whenever a pet of that type","hatches from the egg. Other commands usable in item scripts (see bonus())","will also happily run from pet scripts. Apparently, the pet-specific","commands will also work in NPC scripts and modify the behavior of the","current pet up until the pet is hatched again. (Which will also occur when","the character is logged in again with the pet still out of the egg.) It is","not certain for how long the effect of such command running from an NPC","script will eventually persist, but apparently, it is possible to usefully","employ them in usable item scripts to create pet buffing items.","Nobody tried this before, so you're essentially on your own here."]}}
