This command works fine in the item scripts.","The same command arguments mean the same things as described above in the","beginning of this document when talking about permanent monster spawns.","Monsters spawned in this manner will not respawn upon being killed.","Unlike the permanent monster spawns, if the mob id is -1, a random monster","will be picked from the entire database according to the rules configured","in the server for dead branches. This will work for all other kinds of","non-permanent monster spawns.","The only very special thing about this command is an event label, which is","an optional parameter. This label is written like","'<NPC object name>::<label name>' and upon the monster being killed, it","will execute the script inside of the specified NPC object starting from","the label given. The RID of the player attached at this execution will be","the RID of the killing character.","<size> can be:","Size_Medium = medium (default)","Size_Small = small","Size_Large = big","<ai> can be:","0 = none (default)","1 = attack/friendly","2 = sphere (Alchemist skill)","3 = flora (Alchemist skill)","4 = zanzou (Kagerou/Oboro skill)","monster(\"place\", 60, 100, \"Poring\", PORING, 1, \"NPCNAME::OnLabel\");","The coordinates of 0,0 will spawn the monster on a random place on the","map.
