The NPC name may be omitted, in which case the calling NPC is used","as target.","Contrary to addtimer()/deltimer() commands which let you have many different","timers referencing different labels in the same NPC, each with their own","countdown, initnpctimer() can only have one per NPC object. But it can","trigger many labels and let you know how many were triggered already and","how many still remain.","This timer is counting up from 0 in ticks of 1/1000ths of a second each.","Upon  creating this timer, the execution will not stop, but will happily","continue onward. The timer will then invoke new execution threads at","labels \"OnTimer<time>:\" in the NPC object it is attached to.","To create the timer, use the initnpctimer(), which will start it running.","stopnpctimer() will pause the timer, without clearing the current tick,","while startnpctimer() will let the paused timer continue.","By default timers do not have a RID attached, which lets them continue","even if the player that started them logs off. To attach a RID to a timer,","you can either use the optional \"attach flag\" when using","initnpctimer()/startnpctimer(), or do it manually by using attachnpctimer().","Likewise, the optional flag of stopnpctimer() lets you detach any RID after","stopping the timer, and by using detachnpctimer() you can detach a RID at","any time.","Normally there is only a single timer per NPC, but as an exception, as","long as you attach a player to the timer, you can have multiple timers","running at once, because these will get stored on the players instead of","the NPC.","NOTE: You need to attach the RID before the timer _before_ you start it to","get a player-attached timer. Otherwise it'll stay a NPC timer (no effect).","If the player that is attached to the npctimer logs out, the","\"OnTimerQuit:\" event label of that NPC will be triggered, so you can do","the appropriate cleanup (the player is still attached when this event is","triggered).","The setnpctimer() command will explicitly set the timer to a given tick.","getnpctimer() provides timer information. Its parameter defines what type:","0 - Will return the current tick count of the timer.","1 - Will return 1 if there are remaining \"OnTimer<ticks>:\" labels in the","specified NPC waiting for execution.","2 - Will return the number of times the timer has triggered and will","trigger an \"OnTimer<tick>:\"  label in the specified NPC.","Example 1:","<NPC Header> {","// We need to use attachnpctimer() because the mes command below","// needs RID attach","attachnpctimer();","initnpctimer();","npctalk(\"I cant talk right now, give me 10 seconds\");","end;","OnTimer5000:","npctalk(\"Ok 5 seconds more\");","end;","OnTimer6000:","npctalk(\"4\");","end;","OnTimer7000:","npctalk(\"3\");","end;","OnTimer8000:","npctalk(\"2\");","end;","OnTimer9000:","npctalk(\"1\");","end;","OnTimer10000:","stopnpctimer();","mes(\"[Man]\");","mes(\"Ok we can talk now\");","detachnpctimer();","// and remember attachnpctimer() and detachnpctimer() can only be used","// while the NPC timer is not running!","}","Example 2:","OnTimer15000:","npctalk(\"Another 15 seconds have passed.\");","// You have to use initnpctimer() instead of setnpctimer(0).","// This is equal to setnpctimer(0); startnpctimer();.","// Alternatively, you can also insert another 'OnTimer15001:' label","// so that the timer won't stop.","initnpctimer();","end;","// This OnInit label will run when the script is loaded, so that the","// timer is initialized immediately as the server starts.
