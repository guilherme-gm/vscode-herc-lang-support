This can be either a number","or constant, with the common statuses (mostly negative) found in","'doc/constants.md' under 'Status Changes'. A full list is located in","'src/map/status.h', though they are not currently documented.","The duration of the status is given in <ticks>, or milleseconds.","Certain status changes take an additional parameter <value 1>, which typically","modifies player stats by the given number or percentage. This differs for each","status, and is sometimes zero.","Optional value <rate> is the chance that the status will be invoked (10000 = 1%).","This is used primarily in item scripts. When used in an NPC script, a flag MUST","be defined for the rate to work.","Optional value <flag> is how the status change start will be handled (a bitmask).","SCFLAG_NONE      = 0x00: No special behavior.","SCFLAG_NOAVOID   = 0x01: Status change cannot be avoided.","SCFLAG_FIXEDTICK = 0x02: Tick cannot be reduced by stats (default).","SCFLAG_LOADED    = 0x04: sc_data was loaded, no value will be altered.","SCFLAG_FIXEDRATE = 0x08: Rate cannot be reduced.","SCFLAG_NOICON    = 0x10: Status icon (SI) won't be shown.","If a <GID> is given, the status change will be invoked on the specified character","instead of the one attached to the script. This can only be defined after setting","a rate and flag.","sc_start2() and sc_start4() allow extra parameters to be passed, and are used only","for effects that require them. The meaning of the extra values vary depending on the","effect type.","sc_end() will remove a specified status effect. If SC_ALL (-1) is given, it will","perform a complete removal of all statuses (although permanent ones will re-apply).","Examples:","// This will poison the invoking character for 10 minutes at 50% chance.","sc_start(SC_POISON, 600000, 0, 5000);","// This will bestow the effect of Level 10 Blessing.","sc_start(SC_BLESSING, 240000, 10);","// This will end the Freezing status for the invoking character.","sc_end(SC_FREEZE);","Note: to use SC_NOCHAT you should alter Manner","Manner = -5;\t// Will mute a user for 5 minutes","Manner = 0;\t// Will unmute a user","Manner = 5;\t// Will unmute a user and prevent the next use of 'Manner'"]}}
