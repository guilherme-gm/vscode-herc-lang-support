The script proceeds","immediately after the NPC begins moving.","npcstop() will stop the motion.","While in transit, the NPC will be clickable, but invoking it will cause it","to stop moving, which will make it's coordinates different from what the","client computed based on the speed and motion coordinates. The effect is","rather unnerving.","Only a few NPC sprites have walking animations, and those that do, do not","get the animation invoked when moving the NPC, due to the problem in the","NPC walking code, which looks a bit silly.
