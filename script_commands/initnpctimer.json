			"Contrary to addtimer()/deltimer() commands which let you have many different\n",

			"This timer is counting up from 0 in ticks of 1/1000ths of a second each.\n",

			"labels \"OnTimer<time>:\" in the NPC object it is attached to.\n",
			"\n",
			"To create the timer, use the initnpctimer(), which will start it running.\n",
			"stopnpctimer() will pause the timer, without clearing the current tick,\n",
			"while startnpctimer() will let the paused timer continue.\n",
			"\n",
			"By default timers do not have a RID attached, which lets them continue\n",

			"you can either use the optional \"attach flag\" when using\n",
			"initnpctimer()/startnpctimer(), or do it manually by using attachnpctimer().\n",
			"Likewise, the optional flag of stopnpctimer() lets you detach any RID after\n",
			"stopping the timer, and by using detachnpctimer() you can detach a RID at\n",
			"any time.\n",
			"\n",
			"Normally there is only a single timer per NPC, but as an exception, as\n",
			"long as you attach a player to the timer, you can have multiple timers\n",
			"running at once, because these will get stored on the players instead of\n",

			"NOTE: You need to attach the RID before the timer _before_ you start it to\n",

			"If the player that is attached to the npctimer logs out, the\n",
			"\"OnTimerQuit:\" event label of that NPC will be triggered, so you can do\n",
			"the appropriate cleanup (the player is still attached when this event is\n",
			"triggered).\n",

			"\n",
			" 0 - Will return the current tick count of the timer.\n",
			" 1 - Will return 1 if there are remaining \"OnTimer<ticks>:\" labels in the\n",
